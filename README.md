# From-Pixels-to-3D-Semi-Calibrated-Stereo-Reconstruction-and-Depth-Validation

## Image Capture Setup

This section documents the stereo image collection process for reconstructing 3D scene geometry using epipolar constraints.

---

### **Hardware**
- **Device Used:** iPhone 12 Pro Max  
- **Lens Used:** Main wide-angle lens (5.1 mm focal length)  
- **Image Format:** Captured in `.HEIC`, converted to `.JPG`  
- **Zoom Setting:** 1.5Ã— (confirmed no lens switch; focal length from EXIF = 5.1 mm)  
- **Resolution:** 4032 Ã— 3024 px  

---

### ðŸŽ¯ **Scene Description**
- **Type of Scene:** High-texture, non-repetitive printed poster with ruler taped below for scale.  
- **Lighting:** Indoor, uniform lighting (no shadows or specularities).  
- **Texture Quality:** High (no repeating patterns).  
  

---

### **Stereo Geometry**
- **Number of Views:** 2  
- **Baseline Distance:** 36 cm  
- **Camera Orientation:** Both images taken with phones placed on a stand with mild angular offset (~10â€“15Â°).  
- **Object Distance from Camera:** ZZ cm *(center of scene)*  

---

### **Capture Method**
1. Two images captured from slightly different positions (left and right) to create disparity.  
2. Camera settings were not changed between shotsâ€”no zoom or exposure adjustments.  
3. Baseline and object distances were measured using a physical tape for ground truth depth comparison.

## Steps
1. [Step 1: Data Collection](DataCollection.md)
2. [Step 2: Intrinsic Matrix Calculations](Intrinsic_matrix.md)



## âœ… Project To-Do: From Stereo Images to Depth Validation

-----

### ðŸŸ© 1. Stereo Pair Selection
- [ ] Detect SIFT (or ORB) features in all 10 Ã— 10 stereo pairs.
- [ ] Match features and apply Loweâ€™s ratio test.
- [ ] Rank pairs by number of **inlier matches** (via `cv2.findFundamentalMat` + RANSAC).
- [ ] **Select the best leftâ€“right image pair** for reconstruction.

âœ… *Outcome:* The best stereo pair for 3D processing.

---

### ðŸŸ© 2. Camera Intrinsics Preparation
- [ ] Use extracted EXIF focal length (5.1 mm) and sensor width to calculate **focal length in pixels**.
- [ ] Build the intrinsic matrix \( K \) using:

  \[
  K = 
  \begin{bmatrix}
  f_x & 0 & c_x \\\\
  0 & f_y & c_y \\\\
  0 & 0 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]

  with \( c_x = \text{image width}/2 \), \( c_y = \text{image height}/2 \)

âœ… *Outcome:* Intrinsic matrix \(K\) for both images.

---

### ðŸŸ© 3. Estimate Fundamental and Essential Matrix
- [ ] Detect and match features for the selected pair.
- [ ] Estimate **Fundamental Matrix (F)** using RANSAC.
- [ ] Compute **Essential Matrix (E)** as \( E = K^\top F K \).
- [ ] Decompose \( E \rightarrow R, t \) (up to scale and ambiguity).
- [ ] Select the correct R, t using **cheirality check** (points must be in front of both cameras).

âœ… *Outcome:* Complete stereo calibration â€” known intrinsics and extrinsics.

---

### ðŸŸ© 4. Dense Stereo Matching
- [ ] Rectify the selected stereo image pair (use \(R, t\), or `cv2.stereoRectify`).
- [ ] Compute **dense disparity map** using block matching or Semi-Global Matching (e.g., `cv2.StereoSGBM_create`).
- [ ] Visualize and normalize the disparity map.

âœ… *Outcome:* Dense disparity map covering most of the image.

---

### ðŸŸ© 5. Depth Estimation
- [ ] Convert disparity \(d\) to depth \(Z\) using the formula:

  \[
  Z = \frac{f \cdot B}{d}
  \]

  where:
  - \(f\): focal length in pixels  
  - \(B\): baseline distance (in cm)  
  - \(d\): disparity value at a pixel

âœ… *Outcome:* Per-pixel depth map (Z values).

---

### ðŸŸ© 6. Depth Validation
- [ ] Choose a clearly visible point in the image (e.g., a point on the ruler or center book).
- [ ] Annotate the corresponding pixel in the disparity map.
- [ ] Compute the estimated depth \(Z\) at that pixel.
- [ ] Compare with manually measured depth (e.g., 64 cm from schematic).
- [ ] Compute absolute error or percent error.

âœ… *Outcome:* Quantitative validation of 3D reconstruction accuracy.

---

### ðŸŸ© Optional (Bonus)
- [ ] Visualize the 3D point cloud using `cv2.reprojectImageTo3D()` or Open3D.
- [ ] Compute reprojection error by projecting triangulated points back into image space.

---

âœ… This checklist ensures a full end-to-end stereo vision pipeline with measurable results and ground truth validation.
