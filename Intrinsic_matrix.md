# Calculating the Camera Intrinsic Matrix from Image Metadata

## 1. Parse Image Metadata

- Load image metadata from a JSON or EXIF file.
- Extract the following fields:
  - **Image width** (pixels)
  - **Image height** (pixels)
  - **Focal length** (mm)
  - **35mm equivalent focal length** (mm)



## 2. Give and To find

- We have the physical Focal length, and we need th efocal length along x and y directions in pixels.
- This requires, sensor dimensions(width and height) (physical dimension) - these dimension are usually not mentioned in th specifications.
- hence we calculate the sensor dimensions from equivalent focal length and aspect ratio by first calulating crop factor, then sesor diagonal and then sensor width and height.
- using these sensor dimension we can calculate effective focal length in x and y direction in pixels!



## 3. Calculate Crop Factor

The crop factor is calculated as:

<!-- $$
\text{crop\_factor} = \frac{\text{equivalent\_focal\_length}_{mm}}{\text{focal\_length}_{mm}}
$$ -->
`crop_factor = equivalent_focal_length_mm / focal_length_mm`

This determines how your sensor compares to a full-frame (35mm) sensor.



## 4. Estimate Sensor Size

Assume a full-frame diagonal of **43.3 mm** (standard for 35mm sensors).

Calculate the sensor diagonal:

$$
\text{sensor\_diagonal} = \frac{\text{full\_frame\_diagonal}}{\text{crop\_factor}}
$$


For a 4:3 aspect ratio sensor:

$$
x = \frac{\text{sensor\_diagonal}}{5}
$$

$$
\text{sensor\_width}_{mm} = 4x
$$

$$
\text{sensor\_height}_{mm} = 3x
$$



## 5. Calculate Focal Length in Pixels

Convert the focal length from millimeters to pixels:

$$
f_x = \frac{\text{focal\_length}_{mm} \times \text{image\_width}}{\text{sensor\_width}_{mm}}
$$

$$
f_y = \frac{\text{focal\_length}_{mm} \times \text{image\_height}}{\text{sensor\_height}_{mm}}
$$



## 6. Set Principal Point

Assume the principal point is at the image center:

$$
c_x = \frac{\text{image\_width}}{2}
$$

$$
c_y = \frac{\text{image\_height}}{2}
$$



## 7. Construct the Intrinsic Matrix

The intrinsic matrix $K$ is:

$$
K = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x & 0 & c_x \\
0 & f_y & c_y \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$


## 8. Notes & Limitations

- **Aspect Ratio:** These calculations assume a 4:3 sensor from the aspect ratio of the images. (We split the sensor diagonal into 4:3 ratio!)
- **Metadata Accuracy:** The result depends on the accuracy of the metadata.
- **Principal Point:** The image center is a common assumption but may not be exact for all cameras.



### üîç Observation: Square Pixels

One key observation is that the computed focal lengths along the x and y axes (`f_x` and `f_y`) are nearly identical. This suggests that the image pixels are square in shape. Since the physical size of a pixel is the same in both the horizontal and vertical directions, the physical focal length is projected equally along both axes in pixel units, resulting in `f_x ‚âà f_y`.
